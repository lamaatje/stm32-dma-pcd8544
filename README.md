# PCD8544 library
This is a minimalistic library for STM32
## DMA based
A full frame of 504 bytes takes only about 1 ms to transfer at full clockspeed. The CPU is only involved in setting up the DMA transfer and manipulation of the frame buffer. CSn control is software based.
## Minimalistic
The library has only 5 calls and supports writing text using a 8x6 font to the display lines and also supports raw buffer access.
## Porting
Porting is very, very simple in the header file just provide the pins allocated on your board:
- LCD_RESET_PIN
- LCD_CE_PIN
- LCD_DC_PIN

Provide the SPI resource generated by CubeMx via:
- LCD_SPI_INTERFACE 
## Application code snippets

Clearing the display:
```
memset(LCD_GetFB(),0,LCD_FB_SIZE);
LCD_WriteFB();
```
Writing a string to a line:
```
LCD_WriteLine(0,0,"Hello world!");
LCD_WriteFB();
```
Writing a bitmap:
```
const uint8_t mybitmap[] = {
/* 504 values */
}
memcpy(LCD_GetFB(),mybitmap,LCD_FB_SIZE);
LCD_WriteFB();
```
